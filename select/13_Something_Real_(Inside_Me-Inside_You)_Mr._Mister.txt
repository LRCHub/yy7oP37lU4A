Everyone's looking for something real
Everyone's taking all they can steal
Brother to sister, look at eachother face to face
There's something missing here in this human race - hey

Chorus:
Inside me (all we want is something real)
Is a part of you (we can make this last forever)
And I know inside you (make a world where we can feel)
Is a part of me (we will always be together)

Yeah

Person to person, place to place
We run from eachother, lost in the race
Brother to sister, hold on to eachother with all we got
Our time is coming, if you're ready or not, if you're ready or not, oh

(Chorus)

Gimme something real (all we want is something real)
Gimme something real (we can make this last forever)
Inside you (make a world where we can feel)
Is a part of me (we will always be together) - yeah, yeah

(Solo)

Brother to sister, hold on to eachother with all we got
Our time is coming, oh, if you're ready or not, if you're ready or not, oh

(Chorus)

Gimme something real (all we want is something real)
Something real (we can make this last forever)
Inside you (make a world where we can feel) make a world where we can feel
(We will always be together) we will always be together

(All we want is something real) something real
(We can make this last forever)
Inside you (make a world where we can feel)
Is a part of me (we will always be together)... (to fade)
